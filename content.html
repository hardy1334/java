						<h1>What does MMORPG stands for?</h1>
						<h3>The detailed description of MMORPG goes in the name itself.</h3>
						<p>Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games, also known as <strong>MMORPG</strong>, is a combination of multiplayer and role-playing games.
						Players assign themselves roles in the game and enter a virtual world where they can interact with other players like them. The virtual world is often
						a fanrtasy world in which the user has to accomplish certain tasks that involve fantasy elements such as <strong>monsters, quests, loot</strong> etc.</p>
						
						<p>The term, <strong>MMORPG</strong> was coined by <em>Richard Garriot.</em> Before this coinage, it was generally called <strong><em>graphical MUD.</em></strong>
						The earliest traces of this technology can be found during the <em>mid 1970's</em>, when games such as <strong><em>Mazewar</em></strong> and <strong><em>MUD1</em></strong>
						were released.</p>
						
						<p> Finally the <strong>MMORPG's</strong> we play today began with the <em>Meridian 59</em> in 1996. This was the first game which offered 3D first-person graphics.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<h4>What actually takes to make an MMORPG server?</h4>
						<p>How can people from all over the world play together in a virtual world? Well the answer is not that simple. To run an <strong>MMORPG</strong>, you need a server.
						The development of <strong>MMORPG</strong> server requires various network protocols, security, database design and an expertise with client/server architecture.</p>
						<hr />
						<aside>
						<h4>Trends</h4>
						As this genre is developing so rapidly, there isn't only one trend which it follows. Few trends are mentioned below.
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Instance Dungeons</strong>
							<p>In this trend, the isntances are copied for individuals which kep those individuals seperate from the rest of the world.
							This reduces the amount of data sent to the server, hence reducing <em>lag.</em></p>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Player created content</strong>
							<p>Increased amounts of "player-created content" is another trend.</p>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Browser-based MMORPGs</strong>
							<p>They require no download outside of a browser and usually have heavily integrated social media sharing features. An example of a browser-based MMORPG is Freewar.</p>
							</li>

						<h4>Economics</h4>
						<strong>Edward Castronova</strong> demonstrated that a supply and demand market exists in the virtual world, where players can buy in-game items through real money.
						This idea changed the gaming industry. Gamers started using real world money in the games to boost up their skills and progress within the games.
						The few requirements of this crossover were:
						
							<ul>
						    <li>The ability for players to sell an item to each other for in-game (virtual) currency.</li>
							<li>Bartering for items between players for items of similar value.</li>
							<li>The purchase of in-game items for real-world currency.</li>
							<li>Exchanges of real-world currencies for virtual currencies.</li>
							</ul>
